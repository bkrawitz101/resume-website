                        <p>The Design Science Studio is an educational incubator for art created by the Buckminster Fuller Institute and habRitual, that scaffolds, mentors and funds artists to inspire and propel us into a regenerative future. The program takes artists on a learning journey through a mind bending curriculum to produce planet-conscious art. Following the ideas of visionaries like Buckminster Fuller and many modern system thinkers, philosophers, activists, scientists and visionary polymaths, we help artists create content that can create cultural shifts. The program culminates in a series of digital and physical showcases and large scale campaigns to imagine and facilitate the transition to a future where all beings thrive through celebration and art.</p>
